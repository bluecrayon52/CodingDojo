                <p>
                    The click event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, 
                    and the mouse button is pressed and released. Any HTML element can receive this event.

                        With no parameters, the .hide() method is the simplest way to hide an element.
                        The matched elements will be hidden immediately, with no animation.
                        When a duration, a plain object, or a "complete" function is provided, 
                        .hide() becomes an animation method. The .hide() method animates the width, 
                        height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously. 
                        When these properties reach 0, the display style property is set to none to ensure 
                        that the element no longer affects the layout of the page.
                    </p>
                    <p class="show">
                        With no parameters, the .show() method is the simplest way to display an element.
                        The matched elements will be revealed immediately, with no animation.
                        When a duration, a plain object, or a "complete" function is provided, 
                        .show() becomes an animation method. The .show() method animates the width, 
                        height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously.
                        If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete.

                        With no parameters, the .toggle() method simply toggles the visibility of elements.
                        The matched elements will be revealed or hidden immediately, with no animation, 
                        by changing the CSS display property. If the element is initially displayed, it will be hidden; if hidden,
                         it will be shown.

                    The .slideDown() method animates the height of the matched elements. 
                    This causes lower parts of the page to slide down, making way for the revealed items.
                    Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. 
                    The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, r
                    espectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the duration parameter is omitted, 
                    the default duration of 400 milliseconds is used.

                <p>
                    The .slideToggle() method animates the height of the matched elements. 
                    This causes lower parts of the page to slide up or down, appearing to reveal or 
                    conceal the items. If the element is initially displayed, it will be hidden; if hidden, 
                    it will be shown. The display property is saved and restored as needed. 
                    If an element has a display value of inline, then is hidden and shown, 
                    it will once again be displayed inline. When the height reaches 0 after a hiding animation, 
                    the display style property is set to none to ensure that the element no longer affects the 
                    layout of the page. Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower 
                    animations, not faster ones. The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied to indicate 
                    durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively.

                    The .fadeIn() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. 
                    It is similar to the .fadeTo() method but that method does not unhide the element and can specify 
                    the final opacity level. Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower 
                    animations, not faster ones. The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied to indicate 
                    durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied,

                    It's important to note that this method does not replace a class. It simply adds the class, 
                    appending it to any which may already be assigned to the elements. Before jQuery version 1.12/2.2, 
                    the .addClass() method manipulated the className property of the selected elements, not the class attribute. 
                    Once the property was changed, it was the browser that updated the attribute accordingly. 
                    An implication of this behavior was that this method only worked for documents with HTML DOM semantics (e.g., not pure XML documents).
                    As of jQuery 1.12/2.2, this behavior is changed to improve the support for XML documents, including SVG. Starting from this version, 
                    the class attribute is used instead. So, .addClass() can be used on XML or SVG documents.
                    More than one class may be added at a time, separated by a space, to the set of matched elements.
                </p>
                <p class="remove">
                    If a class name is included as a parameter, then only that class will be removed from the set of matched elements. 
                    If no class names are specified in the parameter, all classes will be removed. Before jQuery version 1.12/2.2, 
                    the .removeClass() method manipulated the className property of the selected elements, not the class attribute. 
                    Once the property was changed, it was the browser that updated the attribute accordingly. 
                    This means that when the class attribute was updated and the last class name was removed, 
                    the browser might have set the attribute's value to an empty string instead of removing the attribute completely.

                        The .before() and .insertBefore() methods perform the same task. 
                        The major difference is in the syntax—specifically, in the placement of the content and target. 
                        With .before(), the content to be inserted comes from the method's argument: $(target).before(contentToBeInserted). 
                        With .insertBefore(), on the other hand, the content precedes the method and is inserted before the target, 
                        which in turn is passed as the .insertBefore() method's argument: $(contentToBeInserted).insertBefore(target).

                        The .append() method inserts the specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery collection 
                        (To insert it as the first child, use .prepend()). The .append() and .appendTo() methods perform the same task. 
                        The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content and target. With .append(), 
                        the selector expression preceding the method is the container into which the content is inserted. With .appendTo(), 
                        on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, 
                        and it is inserted into the target container.

                        In an HTML document, .html() can be used to get the contents of any element. 
                        If the selector expression matches more than one element, only the first match will have 
                        its HTML content returned.

                    <p>
                        When .html() is used to set an element's content, any content that was in that element is 
                        completely replaced by the new content. Additionally, jQuery removes other constructs such as 
                        data and event handlers from child elements before replacing those elements with the new content.

                        The .attr() method gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set. 
                        To get the value for each element individually, use a looping construct such as jQuery's .each() 
                        or .map() method.

                    select and textarea. When called on an empty collection, it returns undefined.
                    When the first element in the collection is a select-multiple (i.e., a select element with 
                    the multiple attribute set), .val() returns an array containing the value of each selected option.
